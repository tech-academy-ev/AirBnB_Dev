# AirBnB_Dev
AirBnB project development.

First rough draft of exercise ideas:

1. Plot number of available apartments over time (use calendar_summary files column available)
2. Histogram of prices and in addition to that histograms of prices differentiated e.g. by neighborhood_group (use file listings.csv - or be more specific about grouping by using additional info like room_type from listings_summary files by mergin on id)
3. Plot listings on a map (could be augmented by selecting different colors for different listing types)
4. If merging files hasn't been used above (pedagogically the merging task should probably not be near the beginning) here could be a place for merging files

5. Machine learning part (predicting prices from reviews, ISMA type of tasks ..)

Had to split some data files due to file size constraints in github.
